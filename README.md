# Programming Challenges

This project is a collection of programming challenges that I have been asked
to solve during interviews, or that I have read about and found interesting!

The solutions here are for learning purposes and do not necessarily reflect the
best or most efficient answers.

I am very open to feedback on how I can improve either the explanations of or
solutions to the challenges in this project.
